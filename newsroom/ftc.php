                <p>The FCC wants to establish clear and transparent processes to support supplemental Internet coverage from space. </p>

                <p>Connecting consumers to essential wireless services where traditional terrestrial mobile service is not available can be lifesaving in remote locations and can open up innovative opportunities for consumers and businesses, according to the FCC.  </p>

                    Broadband Internet is a basic necessity in today’s modern world. This basic necessity is an <span>$875 billion</span> dollar global market.</p>

                <p>This is exciting news for DigitalLocations as it shows the viability for a direct to device solution. We are working with a world-class tech team at Florida International University on the development of Satenna.</p>

                <p>We believe that no matter which path the current regulation takes, Satenna will be a valuable technology.  </p>
